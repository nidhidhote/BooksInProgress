# BooksInProgress
This repository included interesting books related to software development.
Books are the great source to clarify the understanding of any topic you want to master. Currently reading Head First JAVA, the book consists of very interesting and interactive examples of object-oriented programming.
Once it is completed, will write a detailed review about why one should read a book/blogs to understand any topic instead of watching videos related to that topic.
